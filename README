	in-memory model is necessary for potential visualization purposes in the GUI later on.

**	project (module)
	
--	project (class)
	# An in-memory instance of a "project." Contains global project information:
	# Project name. Basic project functionality: loadExisting, saveMetaData.
	
	**	projectNodes
		--	Node
			# Abstract Node. Contains a list of children and a reference to parent.
			# Representative of a generic folder. Should contain overridable method
			# "checkIntegrity" to allow concrete nodes to check their own structure for
			# errors.
		
		--	versionedNode
			# Abstract Node. Inherits from Node class. Contains additional methods for
			# checkout, checkin, and install.
		
		--	rootNode
			# Concrete Node. Inherits from Node. Represents the root project folder.
			# Folder contains at least: "assets","globals","sequences"
	
		--	assetNode
			# Concrete Node. Inherits from versionedNode. Represents a project asset folder.
			# Folder contains "src" and "inst" directories. This node should contain a
			# "packageType" used to separate maya and houdini (or other packages) type assets.
	
		--	shotNode
			# Concrete Node. Represents a project shot folder. Folder contains an animationNode,
			# an fxNode, and a finalNode. It is intended to be used as a containing folder for 
			# the necessary elements of a shot.
		
		--	animationNode
			# Concrete Node. Represents a project shot folder. Folder contains "src","inst", and
			# "cache" directories. Should contain additional method for caching functionality.
			# It is intended to be used for per shot animation.
		
		--	fxNode
			# Concrete Node. Represents a project fx folder. Folder contains "src" and "inst"
			# directories. This node should contain a "packageType" used to separate maya and
			# houdini (or other packages). It is intended to be used for per shot fx.
		
		--	finalNode
			# Concrete Node. Represents a project final shot folder. Folder contains "src",
			# "inst", and "render" directories. It is intended to be used for lighting and
			# rendering.
		
		--	subNode
			# Concrete Node. Represents a project sub-folder. Only allowed to contain other
			# directories; no files.
